## ✨ What Changed (Technical)

**Removed**: Complex Next.js middleware (was causing 500 errors)
**Added**: Simple client-side PasswordGate component

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No middleware invocation errors
- ✅ Works reliably on all devices
- ✅ Faster page loads (no server-side auth checks)
- ✅ Same password experience you wanted: just "gauntletai"

## 🔐 Security Note

This is **client-side password protection** suitable for demo/presentation purposes. For production:
- Use server-side authentication
- Implement proper user management
- Add OAuth/SSO
- Use encrypted sessions

**Everything works now!** 🎊
